T. Systemic Venous Rerouting Through the Coronary Sinus for ccTGA With Bilateral SVCs.
A. The double-switch operation for congenitally corrected transposition of the great arteries, in which the morphologic left ventricle is restored to the systemic circulation, is an effective surgical option. This case report describes an atrial switch technique without using supplemental material during the double-switch operation for congenitally corrected transposition of the great arteries associated with persistent left superior vena cava, with the systemic venous blood flow rerouted through the enlarged coronary sinus.
